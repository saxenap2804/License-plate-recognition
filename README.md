## YOLO-Driven Real-Time Vehicle Recognition

## This project enhances the LittleYOLO-SPP model for real-time vehicle recognition, focusing on improving detection accuracy, usability, and performance. 

This project focuses on enhancing the capabilities of the LittleYOLO-SPP model for real-time vehicle detection and analysis. This project refines the original implementation by addressing code errors, introducing JSON output for structured data, and incorporating advanced image preprocessing techniques, such as resizing and CLAHE, to improve detection accuracy. Additionally, it extends functionality by enabling the detection and classification of vehicle colors, enriching the data output for deeper analysis. The model was retrained using larger image sizes, additional preprocessing steps, and extended training epochs, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall compared to the original implementation. The project aims to make vehicle detection more robust and user-friendly, with future plans to integrate video-based recognition for real-time tracking. This work demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and computer vision to solve domain-specific problems like traffic monitoring and vehicle analysis.
